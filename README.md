# gifted
Gifted is a website built to help facilitate gift exchanges between a family or group of friends. I have five siblings,
so I personally wanted a way to better organize gift-giving for Christmas.

For my particular use case, and because I have such a big family, each participant randomly gets assigned a person to 
purchase a gift for. This is prominently displayed in the UI, but gifters can also purchase gifts for others not 
directly assigned. The core functionality of the app revolves around tracking which gifts have been purchased for whom.
